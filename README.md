Just started out of pure curiosity, uploading files that I've decompiled or dissected into the original source code while learning about RE, thinking it would make me look cool in the eyes of those who see it.

Initially, I created this out of frustration with people hiding their code on public/open source platforms like GITHUB, and it really hindered me from learning by looking at someone else's code.

About 2 years ago, this repository was last updated by my colleague [@Rizemary](https://github.com/Rizemary). Thanks for the stars! It's been more than 3 years since this repository was created!

Contribution's are always welcome!! Thanks.
